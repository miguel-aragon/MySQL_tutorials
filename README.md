# MySQL_tutorials

## Description

This is the code for a tutorial on SQL I gave several years ago. At the time there was no easy way of connecting to a database from IDL and one had to apply some dirty tricks. 

Since astronomers are leaving IDL behind in favor of python most of this code is not so relevant anymore. I keep it here as reference.
